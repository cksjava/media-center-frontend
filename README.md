A modern, lightweight music player frontend built with **React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS**, designed to work with the Nostalgia backend media library.

The focus of this frontend is **clarity, speed, and a clean listening experience** for locally scanned music collections.

## Backend Dependency

This frontend **requires the Nostalgia backend** for:

* Album & track metadata
* Cover art (`/covers/*`)
* Playback control
* Directory scanning
* Playlists and favourites

Make sure the backend API base URL is configured correctly in your environment.

---

## Design Philosophy

* **UI should never guess metadata**
* Backend is the source of truth
* Fast navigation, minimal distractions
* Works equally well for:

  * Bollywood soundtracks
  * Large classical collections
  * Western albums with strict metadata

---

## Future Improvements (Planned)

* Album artist & year in album grid
* Disc grouping for multi-disc albums
* Drag-and-drop playlist ordering
* Keyboard shortcuts
* Mini player mode

## License

MIT

If you want, next we can:

* polish the **Favourites page UI**
* design a **Playlist detail page**
* or document the **API contract** cleanly for the backend/frontend boundary
